					'日本的饭菜（日本料理，にほんりょうり）是用眼睛品尝的饭菜，非常讲究装盘，根据饭菜的种类选择不同的器皿（食器，しよつぎ），往往吃一餐要用上二、三十个大小、形状、颜色和质地不同的器皿。日本的饭菜不仅重视味道，而且注重色泽，各种鲜花或花瓣、时令蔬菜的叶或茎等也时常装饰在食物四周。一般来说，关东地区（以东京为中心）味道较浓，关西地区（以大阪、京都为中心）味道较淡。日本人也常在中餐（中华料理）和西餐（西洋料理）中渗入日本的风味，称之为“和风（わふう）”。 '

					'日餐的进餐形式—般分为定食（ていしょく）、弁当（ぺんとう）和会席料理，当然也可以零点。定食即份饭，通常午间用。定食内有米饭、咸菜、酱汤或清汤，其它的蔬菜和肉食可随价格配添。弁当即盒饭，—般饭盒是漆器状的木制品，分四格和五格两种，每格可放—种菜和相应的饭团，而放团上通常放有芝麻，有些还用紫菜（昆布，こんぶ）包上。会席料理是依不同的季节定制的套餐菜谱，多名为“樱”、“松”、“竹”、“梅”等。在会席中，日本人讲究用餐礼节，即不弄出声音、不讲话，安安静静地吃。不把饭、菜、酒等洒到外面弄脏桌子，鱼刺、骨头等也要不显眼地剩在食具里，而不放到桌上。 '
